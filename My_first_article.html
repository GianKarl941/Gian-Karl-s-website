            <hr>  <!--Break line-->
                <p>Nowadays, people use whatever application that they see on the mobile devices
                or on their computers. Especially when it comes to editing documents,
                Poeple would rather use Microsoft office suite than using any other application.
                The problem here is that people are not goood into computers and when their computeer
                is broken, they will ask for help or just throw it and buy the new one instead.
                This is true for everyone, no one knows how to fix their system and this is the
                same for software. No one has the "time" to learn all of these just to do the
                simple things that matters for them.</p>
                <p>So then what is the point? The point is that people had to realise that if
                you want to be more efficient to your workflow and to your daily routine, you
                must have the will to learn something new that will absolutely change your life.
                And today, I will tell the reason why vim should be the main text editor for
                everyone</p>
