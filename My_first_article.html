            <hr>  <!--Break line-->
            <p><img src="learningjsut_curve.png" alt="learning curve of every text editor"><p>
                <p>Nowadays, people use whatever application that they see on the mobile devices
                or on their computers. Especially when it comes to editing documents,
                Poeple would rather use Microsoft office suite than using any other application.
                The problem here is that people are not goood into computers and when their computeer
                is broken, they will ask for help or just throw it and buy the new one instead.
                This is true for everyone, no one knows how to fix their system and this is the
                same for software. No one has the "time" to learn all of these just to do the
                simple things that matters for them.</p>
                <p>So then what is the point? The point is that people are just too dumb to use a computer.
                I'm not trying to say that people are low IQ or something, what i mean is that poeple are
                not considering the better options that already existed on the internet or on your computer
                already (For Linux users). It just weird for me that people say that they need "The Adobe
                suite" when there's a lot of free and open source software that you can use for free and
                at the same time "free as in freedom, not free as free beer". Vim is one of these free
                and open source software that you should try to learn</p>

        <h3 align="center">Vim is a very extensible program</h3>
                <p>Vim it's not only used for editing code in a text file, you can used Vim to
                edit a document by learning Latex or troff/groff, or edit a spreadsheet file using
                Vim, and etc. Vim can also expand it's abilities by creating a .vimrc file (for Vim)
                or init.vim (for Neovim), You can put whatever you want in your config file and
                if you are done adding stuff in your config file, save it and relaunch Vim. It's that
                simple.</p>
                <p>Also you can add plugins to your vimrc file or init.vim file. This is where you can
                turn Vim into an IDE or microsoft office like enviroment, There are plenty of plugins 
                for Vim and all you have to do is to start searching them on google or on duckduckgo
                and click the link to the website and start finding some cool plugins.</p>
